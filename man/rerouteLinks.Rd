\title{Reroute links prior to deletion}
\usage{
rerouteLinks(to.delete, staging, url, dry.run = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{to.delete}{List of projects, assets or versions to be deleted.
Each entry should be a named list containing at least the \code{project} name.
When deleting an asset, the inner list should also contain an \code{asset} name.
When deleting a version, the inner list should also specify a \code{version} name.
Different inner lists may specify different projects, assets or versions.}

\item{staging}{String containing the path to the staging directory.}

\item{url}{String containing the URL of the gobbler REST API.}

\item{dry.run}{Logical scalar indicating whether to perform a dry run of the rerouting.}
}
\value{
A data frame where each row corresponds to a rerouting action, and contains the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{path}, the path to a symbolic link in the registry that was changed by rerouting.
\item \code{copy}, whether the link at `path` was replaced by a copy of its target file.
If \code{FALSE}, the link was merely updated to refer to a new target file.
Specifically, this is a file in one of the to-be-deleted directories specified in \code{to_delete}.
If \code{copy = TRUE}, this is the original linked-to file that was copied to \code{path}.
}

If \code{dry.run=FALSE}, the registry is modified as described by the rerouting actions.
Otherwise, no modifications are performed to the registry.
}
\description{
Reroute symbolic links to files in directories that are to be deleted, e.g., by \code{\link{removeProject}}.
This preserves the validity of links within the Gobbler registry.
}
\details{
Note that rerouting does not actually delete the directories specified in \code{to.delete}.
Deletion requires separate invocations of \code{\link{removeProject}} and friends -
preferably after the user has verified that rerouting was successful!
}
\examples{
info <- startGobbler()
removeProject("test", info$staging, url=info$url) # start with a clean slate.
createProject("test", info$staging, url=info$url)

# Mocking up an asset so we have something interesting to reroute.
src <- allocateUploadDirectory(info$staging)
write(file=file.path(src, "foo"), "BAR")
uploadDirectory("test", "simple", "v1", src, staging=info$staging, url=info$url)
uploadDirectory("test", "simple", "v2", src, staging=info$staging, url=info$url)
uploadDirectory("test", "simple", "v3", src, staging=info$staging, url=info$url)

# Checking out how rerouting works when we delete the first version. 
rerouteLinks(
    list(list(project="test", asset="simple", version="v1")),
    staging=info$staging,
    url=info$url
)
